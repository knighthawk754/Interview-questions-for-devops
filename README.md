## Linux Folder Structure

The folder structure in Ubuntu Linux follows the Filesystem Hierarchy Standard (FHS), which is a standard for organizing the files and directories on a Unix-like operating system. Here is an overview of the main directories you will typically find in Ubuntu:

- **/bin**: Contains essential command-line executable files (binaries) that are available to all users.

- **/boot**: Contains files related to the boot process, including the Linux kernel, initial ramdisk (initrd), and bootloader configuration.

- **/dev**: Contains device files that represent and allow access to various hardware devices on the system.

- **/etc**: Contains system-wide configuration files for various applications and services.

- **/home**: The home directories for individual users. Each user typically has a subdirectory here to store their personal files and settings.

- **/lib** and **/lib64**: These directories contain shared libraries needed by the system and applications. The "lib64" directory is present on 64-bit systems.

- **/mnt**: A general-purpose mount point for temporarily mounting filesystems.

- **/opt**: Contains optional software packages installed on the system. Applications installed here are often self-contained in their own directories.

- **/proc**: A virtual filesystem that provides information about processes and system status. It is used by many system utilities to obtain runtime information.

- **/root**: The home directory for the root user, the administrative superuser.

- **/run**: A temporary filesystem that contains runtime data for various system services. It is cleared on each reboot.

- **/sbin**: Contains system binaries (executable files) that are primarily used by the root user for system administration tasks.

- **/srv**: Contains data for services provided by the system.

- **/tmp**: A directory for temporary files created by applications and users. Its contents are typically cleared on each reboot.

- **/usr**: Contains user-related programs, libraries, documentation, and shared resources. It has subdirectories such as /usr/bin for user binaries, /usr/lib for libraries, and /usr/share for shared data.

- **/var**: Contains variable data that changes during the system's operation, such as logs, databases, and spool files.

This is a high-level overview of the Ubuntu Linux folder structure. Each directory serves a specific purpose in organizing the system's files and resources.

### 6. `mv`

- Description: Moves or renames files and directories.
- Usage:
  - `mv source_file destination_file`: Moves the source file to the destination or renames it.
  - `mv source_directory destination_directory`: Moves the source directory to the destination or renames it.

### 7. `grep`

- Description: Searches for a specific pattern in files or output.
- Usage:
  - `grep pattern file_name`: Searches for the specified pattern in the given file.
  - `grep -r pattern directory`: Searches for the pattern recursively in the specified directory.
  - `command | grep pattern`: Filters the output of a command and searches for the pattern.

### 8. `ps`

- Description: Lists running processes.
- Usage:
  - `ps`: Lists the running processes for the current user.
